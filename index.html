	<p> The trip to Archer Malmo was cool and quiet. We passed by the Orpheum in downtown. We also saw famous restaurants in downtown.  <a href="http://www.archermalmo.com"> Archer Malmo</a> was a great experience to have. They are a coding and website developing company that is independent. The people at Archer Malmo were very friendly and chill. They gave great advice for coding and web-designing. They gave a powerpoint on how they work. The best part is that they bring there dog to work.</p>

	<p> They had a cool building and had cool creative decorations all through out the building. The people at Archer Malmo are incredibly creative. They have a ladder with a bunch of christmas lights. They also have a pencil chair.  They showed us there offices and filming room which had curved corners. The curved corners in the filming room make it an infinity room. When they record and need something to continue then they use the corners to make it infinite.</p><div class="corner"> <img src="img/corner.jpg"></div> <div class="righty">

	<p> At Archer Malmo they were willing to answer question that we had. They gave advice over python, rubby, and javascript. Archer Malmo is a good place to work for coding or web-designing. They weren't working in one language but in the ones they struggled with.
	They had different opinions on which language is more important and useful. They told us how they ended up working at Archer Malmo.  </p>
